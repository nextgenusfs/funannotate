abstract: >-
  Funannotate is a genome prediction, annotation, and
  comparison software package. It was originally written to
  annotate fungal genomes (small eukaryotes ~ 30 Mb
  genomes), but has evolved over time to accomodate larger
  genomes. The impetus for this software package was to be
  able to accurately and easily annotate a genome for
  submission to NCBI GenBank.
